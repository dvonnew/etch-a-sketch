# etch-a-sketch

We will be making an etch-a-sketch game/toy/interactive enviornment or whatever you want to call it

This will consist of an html file (index.html), a CSS file (styles.css), and javacript file (script.js)

Index.Html
- Will contain:
    - head
    - body
        - div with class/id of container

Scripts:
- Will create 16 additional div classes
    - get the container class
    - add div function
        - iterates up to 15 times
        - adding a total 16 divs
        - each div needs a class
    - Change color buttons:
        - change color function
        - changes the mouseover event background color to selected color


- CSS:
    - will control the effects on all divs
    - with the 16:
        - there will be a hover option call by div.class:hover, that will highlight the divs when hovered over
